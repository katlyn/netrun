This directory is for rebuilding the cached "main.obj" when you change:
	- support/project/lib/main.c
	- support/project/lib/inc.h
	- support/project/lib/inc.c
	- support/project/lib/signal.c

To use it, just run rebuild.sh, which will build a tarfile from 
the softlinks in support/, and sandsend it off to the servers.
