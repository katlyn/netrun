These are the NetRun CGI implementations.
Beware: anything named ".cgi" in this directory can 
be *executed* by anybody with a web browser, so 
this directory should only be writeable by root.
To keep passwords secure, one-up directory shouldn't
be readable by anybody either.

"run.cgi" is the main program (released version).
"runt.cgi" is the testing version.  An arbitrary number of 
't' characters are supported (e.g., runtttt.cgi).
